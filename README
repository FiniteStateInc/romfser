romfser - RomFS manipulation tool

With this little tool you can do some limited manipulation of RomFS images.
Compilation:
 # make
This should create an executable called romfser in the current directory.

Running romfser without any arguments will output the following usage message:
	Usage: romfser <image file> <offset in image> <flags> [flags args]
	Example: romfser a.img 802 le touch.css
	The previous example lists all files and directories of the RomFS image a.img with RomFS starting at 802
	bytes offset from the beginning of the image and extracts touch.css in the current directory
	Flags: l - list, e - extract 1 file (1 arg), a - extract all with dir structure in current directory
	       s - substitute two files, the new file should be <= the other file's size since it's overwritten
	           without any header changes
